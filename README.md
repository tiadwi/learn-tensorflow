# learn-tensorflow
My learning notes about tensorflow from Coursera's Course - Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. This course is part of Tensorflow in Practice Specialization by deeplearning.ai.

Machine Learning Course and Deep Learning Specialization from Andrew Ng teaches me best practices for using TensorFlow, a popular open-source framework for machine learning, and how to use TensorFlow to implement Machine Learning and Deep Learning principles so that I can start building and applying scalable models to real-world problems.

Instructor: Laurence Moroney @lmoroney (AI Advocate - Google Brain)

What I have learned: 
- Learn best practices for using TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework
- Build a basic neural network in TensorFlow
- Train a neural network for a computer vision application
- Understand how to use convolutions to improve your neural network
